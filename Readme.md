This is a small platform independend graphics engine in C.

This engine isn't anything fancy.

## Requirements for the engine
This engine sould be as simple as posible to be used in educational environment.
It souldn't require much knowledge of types, structs and other fancy c stuff. (Other than simple points ...)
But it sould be extendable and lightweight and it should be platform independent.
